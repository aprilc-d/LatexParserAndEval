# LatexParserAndEval
A LaTeX parser built in haskell. 
It includes an evaluator capable of approximating infinite series. 
It infers order of operations based on simple rules humans would follow. 

Features I want to add:
1. Integral Approximation
2. Integer evaluation (currently only uses floating points)
